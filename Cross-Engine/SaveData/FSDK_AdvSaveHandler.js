 * Advanced Save Handler - Version R1.00
 * Developed by AceOfAces
 * Licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. Can be used for both non-commercial
 * and commercial games.
 * Please credit me as AceOfAces when you use this plugin.
 * >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 * This cross-engine plugin re-works parts of the save mechanism so it can be
 * customizable and more robust. This is an essential plugin for both users
 * that want to change the location and those who use RPG Maker Cook Tool
 * Deluxe (and it's predecessor, RPG maker MV/MZ Cook Tool). For RPG Maker
 * users, it also fixes a bug where games packed with Enigma Virtual Box
 * cannot save properly.
 * >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 * Installation
 * >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 * RPG Maker MV:
 * Put this below plugins that affect the save system (such as Yanfly's Save Core).
 * Then, open the plugin settings and adjust them accordingly.
 *
 * RPG Maker MZ:
 * This is the same as on MV: Put this below any plugins that affect the save system.
 * Then, open the settings and adjust accordingly.
 * >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 * Configuration
 * >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 * Preferred Location: Selects which base folder should be used. Selecting "Exe
 * location", it will use the game's parent folder (same as default). Selecting
 * "App Data" will set the location to a folder Nwjs reserves. Selecting "User
 * folder", will put the files to the user's folder (recommended).
 *
 * Folder Location: These two versions adjust the save folder's location in
 * the user folder (you can safely ignore these, if you don't use the User
 * folder). You must write the location with "/" as the path separator. The
 * location is set up as follows (with the default settings):
 * Linux & Mac : /home/myusrname/MyGameName/Game Dev/Game Name/userdata/
 * Windows: C:/Users/MyUserName/Saved Games/Game Dev/Game Name/userdata/
 * Game Data sub-folder: This adjusts the name of the folder that will hold
 * the game's data within the selected location (Global, Settings and saves).
 * >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 * Compatibility
 * >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 * RPG Maker MV: Compatible with version 1.6.0 and newer. Older versions may not
 * work properly. Compatible with most plugins. If Yanfly's Save Core is present,
 * it will use its settings for file names.
 * RPG Maker MZ: Compatible with version 1.5.0 and newer. Older versions may not
 * work properly. Compatible with most plugins.
 * >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 * Extra Notes
 * >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 * In RPG Maker MV, save files are placed into a folder named "Saves". This is
 * to better organize the files within the save location. This behaviour isn't
 * present on RPG Maker MZ.
